# EventSchedulerProject
Using C++ Implemented With Data Structure Concept (Console Application)

This is a cosnole  application. Its objective is to schedule the events for the user.
Each event must have:
1. A name
2. A start date
3. An end date
4. A place
5. Event’s start time
6. Reminder time … etc.
The user must be able to:
1. Add,
2. Delete or
3. Update an event.
The application should refuse to add an event that intersects with another event.
The application should make an alarm for the user on the reminder’s time.
Store your data in files, no need for data base.
